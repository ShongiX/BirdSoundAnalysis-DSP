# Bird Sound Analysis - Digital Signal Processing

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts developed for a university subject, Digital Signal Processing. The scripts focus on various audio signal processing techniques, including filtering and noise addition.

## Contents

- `high_pass_filter.py`: Implementation of a high-pass filter for audio signals.
- `knn_freq_classificator.py`: K-Nearest Neighbors classifier based on frequency features.
- `knn_time_classificator.py`: K-Nearest Neighbors classifier based on time-domain features.
- `moving_average_filter.py`: Implementation of a moving average filter.
- `noise_addition.py`: Script for adding random noise to audio signals.
- `noise_addition_batch.py`: Batch processing for adding noise to multiple audio files.
- `spectral_noise_filter.py`: Implementation of a spectral noise filter.

## Project Structure

- **audio**: Contains filtered, noised, and original audio files.
  - **filtered**: Audio files after applying various filters.
  - **noised**: Audio files with added noise at different levels.
  - **noised_batch**: Batch-processed audio files with added noise.
  - **wav**: Original audio files.
- **plots**: Generated plots showcasing the results of different processing steps.

## Project Purpose

This project was created as part of a university subject, Digital Signal Processing. It serves as a practical application of the theoretical concepts covered in the course, allowing students to explore and experiment with real-world audio signal processing scenarios.
